## Getting Started

This example is built with Backbone.js to demonstrate the use and configuration of XDN serving a client-side-rendered application. We utilize the caching and speed optimizations provided by the XDN to serve static resources that are rendered on the client.

To get started with this example, run:

```
npm i
npm run xdn:start
```

and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) with your browser to see the result.
